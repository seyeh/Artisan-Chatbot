## Typing stubs for setuptools

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`setuptools`](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`setuptools`.

This version of `types-setuptools` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `setuptools==74.1.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/setuptools. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

If using `setuptools >= 71.1` *only* for `pkg_resources`,
you don't need `types-setuptools` since `pkg_resources` is now typed.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit

with mypy 1.11.1, pyright 1.1.379, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
